<b>Abstract:</b>
We isolate the causal effect of changing the riskiness of choices on the gender gap in consequential real world decisions. We do so by exploiting a national reform to the regrade system of Norwegian universities which generated exogenous variation in the probabilities of the outcome of regrade requests. Using unique individual-level administrative data, we show that both the expected value of a regrade request, as well as the downside risk, increased substantially as a result of the policy. We then show how the ostensibly gender-neutral policy substantially increased gaps between men and women because they differed in their risk preferences and beliefs. Specifically, the exogenous shift in the riskiness of requesting a regrade augmented the regrade request gap by 90 percent. We demonstrate that the increased gender gap in regrade requests has consequential implications for students through its impact on their grade points. In terms of mechanisms, we show that the increased gender gap was caused by the change in the likelihood of a negative regrade outcome, suggesting that gender differences in risk preferences or beliefs about negative outcomes drive the results. We disentangle the relative importance of these mechanisms through auxiliary reduced-form analyses, structural estimation, and a supplemental lab experiment. We find that beliefs rather than loss aversion drive our findings. The findings reveal how gender differences in preferences and beliefs manifest when men and women make real world decisions.

A Wage Frame Effect </a> <br>(with <a href="http://www.luxishen.com/"> Luxi Shen</a>)<br> <i> Management Science</i>, November, 2022  </summary>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
In jobs in which workers have the flexibility to decide how much work to supply, such as in the gig economy, the effect of a wage change on work supply can be hard to predict. A wage increase, for example, offers workers the opportunity to make more money, so they may want to work more, but at the same time, it allows them to enjoy more leisure, so they do not need to work so much. Economic theory alone does not predict which outcome is more likely to occur, and empirical evidence on the short-term effect of wage change on work supply is also mixed. This research provides some psychological insights into this economic problem by showing that the effect of wage change on work supply depends on how the change is framed. Specifically, for a worker who used to work A hours to earn $X, if the wage change is presented as a payment change (“work the same A hours and earn $Y”), then work supply is expected to change in the same direction as the wage change. By contrast, if the wage change is presented as a workload change (“work B hours and earn the same $X”), then work supply is expected to change in the opposite direction of the wage change. This wage frame effect occurs because in multi-attribute decisions, decision makers assign greater weight to attributes that change than to those that remain constant. A series of experiments (total N = 2,599) demonstrates the wage frame effect on both expressed willingness-to-work and actual work performance, and tests the proposed account as well as alternative explanations. Since any wage change has to be communicated with some specific frame, the choice of the frame can have powerful effects. In fact, it is even possible for a wage decrease to elicit the same increase in work supply as a wage increase. This research (a) offers psychological insights into a classic economic problem, (b) documents a novel framing effect for the judgment and decision-making literature, and (c) suggests a nudge idea in incentive designs to managers and policy makers.

  (with <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/abigail-sussman"> Abigail B. Sussman</a>)<br> <i>Journal of Marketing</i>, December, 2021</summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b>
US Households currently hold $770 billion in credit card debt, often managing repayments across multiple accounts. We investigate how minimum payments (i.e., the requirement to allocate at least some money to each account with a balance) alter consumers’ allocation strategies across multiple accounts. Across four experiments, we find that minimum payment requirements cause consumers to increase dispersion (i.e., spread their repayments more evenly) across accounts. We term this change in strategy the dispersion effect of minimum payments and provide evidence that it can be costly for consumers. We find that the effect is partially driven by the tendency for consumers to interpret minimum payment requirements as recommendations to pay more than the minimum amount. While the presence of the minimum payment requirement is unlikely to change, we propose that marketers and policymakers can influence the effects of minimum payments on dispersion by altering the way that information is displayed to consumers. Specifically, we investigate five distinct information displays and find that choice of display can either exaggerate or minimize dispersion and corresponding costs. We discuss implications for consumers, policy makers, and firms, with a particular focus on ways to improve consumer financial well-being.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We study how ownership affects learning and beliefs. Using an experimental asset market, we find that owning a good leads people to over-extrapolate from signals about its underlying value: after seeing positive signals, people become too optimistic, after seeing negative signals, they become too pessimistic. This result holds relative to a Bayesian benchmark and compared to learning about goods they do not own. In fact, learning is less biased and more "correct" about goods that are not owned. We replicate these results in field data, showing that asset owners over-extrapolate nearly twice as much as non-owners from the same signals.

  <br> (with <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/devin.pope/">  Devin G. Pope</a> and Jihong Song)<br>  <i>AEA Papers and Proceedings</i>, May, 2018 </summary>
    <p>  <b>Abstract:</b>
    A growing literature uses economic behaviors in field settings to test predictions generated by various psychological models. In some cases, psychological theories make conflicting predictions for the same consumer context. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile two conflicting predictions about upgrading behavior, one made by category budgeting (e.g.,Heath and Soll, 1996, Thaler, 1985)—which suggests people will upgrade less as prices go up—and one made by relative thinking (e.g., Kahneman and Tversky, 1981)—which suggests people will upgrade more as prices go up.

<summary>The Effect of Job Loss on Risky Financial Decision-Making <br> (with  Abigail B.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Job loss is a common and disruptive life event. It is known to have numerous long term negative effects on financial, health, and social outcomes. While the negative effects of becoming unemployed on health and well-being are well-understood, the influence of job loss on financial decisions has received little attention. Across  a large-scale survey (N = 37,854), spending data from a bank (N=404,470), and two online experiments (total N=1403), we find that job loss increases financial risk taking. First, in survey data, job-loss is associated with elevated levels of self-reported financial risk taking and lottery ticket purchases. Next, using administrative data from a large bank, we find consistent causal evidence of the influence of job loss on gambling spending. Although total spending decreases after job loss, gambling spending is less affected than our control categories. Finally, we turn to two incentive-compatible manipulations of job loss operationalized in a lab setting. We find that this experimental manipulation increases the take-up of financial risks. The current finding that job loss increases financial risk taking could accentuate long term negative financial effects of job loss.

Would You Use a South-Pointing Compass? Consumers Underestimate the Informativeness of Systematic Errors and Disagreement <br> (with Jay Naborn, <a href="https://olin.wustl.edu/EN-US/Faculty-Research/Faculty/Pages/FacultyDetail.aspx?username=perfecto">Hannah Perfecto</a>,  <a href="https://quentinandre.net/">Quentin Andre</a>, and <a href="https://reinholtzresearch.com/">Nick Reinholtz</a>)   </summary>
<b>Abstract:</b>
Consumers often lean on other people’s opinions when deciding what to purchase, consume, or do. In eight studies, we document a novel bias in people’s use of advice: Consumers are reluctant to seek out and use information from sources that systematically disagree with them, even when these sources are objectively more informative than people who agree with them. We demonstrate this underappreciation of systematic disagreement in various contexts: in choices and ratings of potential advisors, in joint and separate evaluation, and with and without monetary incentives. We explore three candidate mechanisms for the effect: a preference for homophily in social interactions, a belief that disagreement is inherently less informative than agreement when matters of taste are involved, and a positive test strategy in learning (whereby people intuitively consider confirmatory information over disconfirmatory information). The fact that the bias persists in non-social contexts as well as when matters of taste are irrelevant suggests that the first two mechanisms are not central to the effect. In contrast, the effect is attenuated when the consumption decision is framed as a rejection, and when participants are given time to reconsider their choice, which suggests a positive test strategy as a more likely mechanism.

Tests of Rank-dependent Probability Weighting in Risky Choice <br> (with <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/george.wu/"> George Wu</a>)
</summary>
Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) modified Original Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) by permitting decision
weights to be rank-dependent. While rank-dependent decision weights have some well-known theoretical advantages – notably eliminating violation of first-order stochastic dominance and allowing for generalization to probability distributions with a large number of outcomes – they also have strong and testable empirical implications, namely that the decision weights are larger outcomes with higher relative ranks. We test whether decision weights are indeed rank-dependent using a large sample of choices between gambles. The gambles were selected to allow semi-parametric estimation of decision weights. Our estimates show strong evidence for rank-dependent decision weights, with the decision weights for the highest valued outcome significantly larger than the decision weights for the middle outcome, holding the probability of that outcome constant. Our estimated decision weights are substantially closer to Cumulative Prospect Theory than Original Prospect Theory, though both exact models are
rejected in the data. In a prediction exercise, Cumulative Prospect Theory predicted choice shares fit our data on 3 outcome gambles substantially better.

<p><details><summary> (Mis)perceptions of Stability and Learning <br> (with Alex Imas) </summary>
  <p> <b>Abstract:</b>
Expectations and learning from new information are critical inputs to economic behavior. We study how people update their beliefs in stable vs. unstable information environments. We document two novel empirical facts using learning experiments with simple data generating processes. First, people in stable environments update their beliefs “as-if” the environment is unstable. They update their beliefs too much relative to Bayesian learning in response to signals, especially in later rounds of our task. Second, people in simple unstable environments underreact to the possibility of change.  When told about the possibility of change at a specific point in time, people do not update their beliefs enough. We rule out misperceptions of signal diagnosticity, memory constraints, and cognitive uncertainty as drivers of our effects. Finally, we provide convergent evidence that people have a fundamental misperception of stability. They perform substantially better when in an information environment calibrated to prior participants’ perceptions of stability. Our experiments shed light on forecasters’ tendency to both over and underreact to new information.

<p><details><summary> The Interplay of Beliefs and Preferences in Driving the Disposition Effect </summary>
  <p> <b>Abstract:</b>

I examine how biased beliefs interact with preferences to produce one of the most well-studied behavioral anomalies in finance, the disposition effect. I find that participants' beliefs are conservative relative to Bayesian. Participants are more likely to sell goods that a Bayesian would believe are more likely to go up in price; however, they are less likely to sell goods they believe are more likely to go up in price. Then, using both reduced form and structural estimates, I compare the preference parameters necessary to rationalize the disposition effect using Bayesian beliefs, as is standard, to those estimated using subjective beliefs. I find that using participants' subjective beliefs implies a larger influence of realization utility in selling decisions.

<p><details><summary> Body-Worn Cameras and Racial Disparities in Policing: Evidence from the NYPD </summary>
  <p> <b>Abstract:</b>

Racial disparities plague the American criminal justice system and disproportionately impact Black Americans. Local governments face substantial challenges in improving the quality of policing and many are looking for implementable changes. One popular proposal to improve policing is the use of Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs), which record officers' interactions with civilians, and are supposed to increase police accountability. My paper focuses specifically on the racial dynamics of police interactions following introduction of BWCs to the New York Police Department's (NYPD) precincts. I document a significant increase in stops of Black New Yorkers relative to white New Yorkers after the introduction of BWCs to a precinct. The increases in stops are accompanied by increases in arrests and use of force. I provide suggestive evidence, using data on discretionary arrests, that the cameras improve reporting quality suggesting previous underreporting to the SQF database.

<p><details><summary> Ownership Alters Learning and Beliefs about Products <br> (with Abigail B. Sussman, Samuel M. Hartzmark and Alex Imas) 
  </summary>
  <p> <b>Abstract:</b>
    Consumers often make repeated purchase decisions. We investigate how owning a product alters learning about the owned goods as well as other products in the same category or made by the same brand. Across both experimentally controlled and naturally occurring purchase behavior, we show that owners (vs. non-owners) update their beliefs more extremely in response to new information. This exacerbates the effects of motivated reasoning in the positive domain, but attenuates it in the negative domain where it can even become more pessimistic than non-owners. We propose that differential attention to information drives these patterns of updating. Owners also report higher likelihood than non-owners of purchasing another product from a brand with a better product in our assessment task, but are no more likely to do so for for a brand with a worse product. Our results suggest that ownership alters the way consumers incorporate new information about related products and brands into their beliefs.

<p><details><summary> When is Now?: Empirical Tests of Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting <br>(with  <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/bartels/">  Daniel M. Bartels</a>)</summary>
   <p> <b>Abstract:</b>
Quasi-hyperbolic discounting (Laibson, 1997) is often used to model excessive impatience. Our project aims to better understand (i) how quasi-hyperbolic people’s preferences are and (ii) if they are, when does “now” end and the future start? We find “now" periods including tomorrow and a week outperform a "now" period only including today, though all outperform an exponential model. In addition, participants’ best fitting "now” periods are sensitive to magnitudes. Even participants’ responses to questions with a year delay are best fit by a two-parameter model, a pattern inconsistent with the predictions of the quasi-hyperbolic model.
