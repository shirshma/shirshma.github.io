I like coffee more than a person probably should. The map below contains most of the shops I have been to since graduating college. My current top three are probably 
1.  <span class="fn">
      <a href="https://www.timwendelboe.no" target="_blank">Tim Wendelboe  </a> Oslo, Norway (Visited 3/18)
    </span>
2. <span class="fn">
      <a href="http://www.trakterenkoffie.nl/" target="_blank">Trakteren Koffie  </a> Amsterdam, Netherlands (Visited 3/18)
    </span>
3. <span class="fn">
      <a href="http://www.onibuscoffee.com/" target="_blank"> Onibus Coffee</a> Tokyo, Japan (Visited 8/15)
    </span>
    
These days you will most likely find me at <span class="fn">
