I like coffee more than a person probably should. The map below contains most of the shops I have been to since graduating college. My current top three are 
1. <a href src=link1> Tim Wendelboe  </a> Oslo, Norway (Visited 3/18)
2. Trakteren Amsterdam, Netherlands (Visited 3/18)
3. Onibus Coffee Tokyo, Japan (Visited 8/15)
