I’m Connor Dowd. I’m a PhD student in econometrics and statistics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

I primarily study econometrics and statistics, but energy policy, as well as other areas of applied micro interest me. My recent areas of focus have included regression discontinuity, non-parametric inference, and metrics for detecting the ‘hot hand’ in basketball. But several time-series esque areas have crept in recently — looking at cross-validation and random forests in that context.

Prior to starting my PhD, I did some research for the Social Security Advisory Board (an independent commission which works to improve the SSA) looking at revisions to the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). I attended the University of St Andrews for a degree in economics and statistics (my dissertation involved doing simulations around particle filtering applications to finance). I also worked as an RA for Professor David Ulph — investigating the how happiness and well-being differed between the voluntarily and involuntarily unemployed.

Since starting in Chicago, I’ve worked with the Social Enterprise Initiative to start a data collection project looking at social and responsible investment funds and I have been a teaching assistant for Professor Kevin Murphy. I’m starting a project with Professors Max Farrell and Chris Hansen related to policy evaluation. I’m also hoping to begin a project in India looking at energy and environmental issues with EPIC.
