Iâ€™m a Research Associate at University of Colorado Leeds School of Business's Center for Research on Financial Decision Making. I am also a PhD candidate in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I primarily study consumer financial decision making and topics in behavioral economics. My research examines topics related to ownership, financial decision making, learning, and core behavioral economics models like Prospect Theory. For additional details, see my research page. 

<p> Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at RAND in Boston doing health services research. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2013.
