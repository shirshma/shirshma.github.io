Iâ€™m a Post Doc at the CU-Boulder Leeds School of Business. In Fall 2021, I will be joining NHH and FAIR/The Choice Lab. I received my PhD in Behavioral Science from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I primarily study topics in behavioral economics. My research examines ownership, financial decision making, learning, and core behavioral economics models like Prospect Theory. 

<p> Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at RAND in Boston doing health services research. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2013.
