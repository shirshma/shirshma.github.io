I’m a PhD student in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

I primarily study consumer financial decision making with an emphasis on Prospect Theory and Mental Accounting. I am currently working on projects related to
  <p> 1) <details><summary>The ways minimum payments affect credit card debt repayment strategies across multiple cards<br>
  (with Abby Sussman, revise and resubmit _Journal of Consumer Research_)</summary>
  <p>
 While debt can provide important flexibility and opportunity for consumers, interest payments on this debt is costly.  US consumers currently pay an average interest rate of 17% on a total of $15,482 outstanding debt balances, with poor debt management strategies leading consumers to spend even more than necessary on interest payments. We investigate people’s lay theories of optimal credit card debt repayment strategies and examine how minimum payments affect these strategies across multiple cards. We first find that consumers’ lay beliefs do align with the cost-minimizing strategy (i.e., paying the highest interest rate debts first), but that consumers do not place enough emphasis on the importance of interest rates (studies 1a, b). Second, we propose and provide evidence for the dispersion theory in the context of minimum payments: the presence of the minimum payment requirement causes participants to spread excess repayments across more accounts, interfering with implementation of the optimal strategy (Study 2-5). Finally, we find that making an explicit allocation decision for each account moderates the effects of the minimum payment we document in prior studies (Study 6).

  <p>5) Metrics for detecting the ‘hot hand’ in basketball using waiting time properties of binomial distributions (with Connor Dowd and Nick Polson)
  
<p>I am developing ideas related to the impacts of ownership on expectations, loss averion and discounting parameter estimation, and reference dependence in field settings. 


<p> Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at RAND in Boston doing health services research.
