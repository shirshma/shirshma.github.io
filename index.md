I’m a PhD student in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

I primarily study consumer financial decision making with an emphasis on Prospect Theory and Mental Accounting. I am currently working on projects related to
  <p> 1) The ways minimum payments affect credit card debt repayment strategies across multiple cards<br>
        (with Abby Sussman)
  
  <p> 2) The impacts of ownership on beliefs and expectations <br> (with Sam Hartzmark and Alex Imas)
  <p> 3) The way framing of wages affects work supply decisions <br> (with Luxi Shen)
 <p> 4) <a href='/public/Website_mental_budgeting.pdf'> Mental Budgeting vs. Relative Thinking</a><br>
        AEA Papers and Proceedings (with Devin Pope and Jihong Song)

  <p>5) Metrics for detecting the ‘hot hand’ in basketball using waiting time properties of binomial distributions (with Connor Dowd and Nick Polson)
  
<p>I am developing ideas related to the impacts of ownership on expectations, loss averion and discounting parameter estimation, and reference dependence in field settings. 


<p> Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at RAND in Boston doing health services research.
