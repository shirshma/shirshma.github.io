[In Progress]
I’m a PhD student in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

I primarily study Prospect Theory, Mental Accounting, and financial decision making. I am currently working on projects related to credit card debt repayment, upgrading under relative thinking, and metrics for detecting the ‘hot hand’ in basketball. I am developing ideas to apply reference dependence in field settings. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at RAND doing health insurance research.
