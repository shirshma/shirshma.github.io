Iâ€™m a PhD student in Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I primarily study consumer financial decision making with an emphasis on Prospect Theory and Mental Accounting. I am developing ideas related to the impacts of ownership on expectations, loss aversion and discounting parameter estimation, and reference dependence in field settings. For additional details, see my research page. 

<p> Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at RAND in Boston doing health services research. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2013.
